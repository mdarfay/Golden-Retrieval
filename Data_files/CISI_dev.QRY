Directions in Library Networking
.A
Avram, H.D.
McCallum, S.H.
.W
    Bibliographic control before and after MARC is reviewed.  The capability
of keying into online systems brought an interdependence among libraries,
the service centers that mediate between them, and the large utilities that
process and distribute data.  From this has developed the basic network
structure among libraries in the United States.  The independent development
of major networks has brought problems in standardization and coordination.
The authors point out that while technology has led toward centralization
of automated library services, new developments are now pushing toward
decentralization.  Coordination is a requirement to avoid fragmentation in
this new environment.

Approximate String Matching
.A
Hall, P.A.V.
Dowling, G.R.
.W
    Approximate matching of strings is reviewed with the aim of
surveying techniques suitable for finding an item in a database when
there may be a spelling mistake or other error in the keyword.  The
methods found are classified as either equivalence or similarity problems.
Equivalence problems are seen to be readily solved using canonical forms.
For similarity problems difference measures are surveyed, with a full
description of the well-established dynamic programming method relating
this to the approach using probabilities and likelihoods.  Searches for
approximate matches in large sets using a difference function are seen to
be an open problem still, though several promising ideas have been
suggested.  Approximate matching (error correction) during parsing is
briefly reviewed.

of automated micrographic retrieval technology.  The conclusion is that with a
combination of advances in communications technology, and sophisticated indexing
input from libraries and information scientists, the new generation of automated

Algorithms for Processing Partial Match Queries Using Word Fragments
.A
Alagar, V.S.
.W
    Algorithms are given to process partially specified queries in a
compressed database system.  The proposed methods handle effectively
queries that use either whole words or word fragments as language elements.
The methods are compared and critically evaluated in terms of the design
and retrieval costs.  The analyses show that the method which exploits the
interdependence of fragments as well as the relevance of fragments to
records in the file has maximum design cost and least retrieval cost.

Interacting in Natural Language With Artificial Systems:  The Donau Project
.A
Guida, G.
Somalvico, M.
.W
    This paper is intended to propose a new methodological approach to
the conception and development of natural language understanding systems.
This new contribution is supported by the design, implementation, and
experimentation of DONAU:  a general purpose domain oriented natural
language understanding system developed and presently running at the Milan
Polytechnic Artificial Intelligence Project.  The system is based on a two
level modular architecture intended to overcome the lack of flexibility and
generality often pointed out in many existing systems, and to facilitate
the exchange of results and actual experiences between different projects.
The horizontal level allows an independent and parallel development of the
single segments of the system (syntactic analyser, information extractor,
legality controller).  The vertical level ensures the possibility of changing
(enlarging or redefining) the definition of the semantic domain on which each
particular version of the system is oriented and specialized in a simple,
incremental, and user-oriented way.  In the paper the general architecture of
the system and the mode of operation of each segment are illustrated in
detail.  Linguistic models, knowledge representation, and parsing algorithms
are described and illustrated by means of selected examples.  Performance
evaluations of the system in the application version on data base inquiry are
reported and discussed.  Promising directions for future research are presented
in the conclusions.

A Program for Machine-Mediated Searching

Toliver, D.

    A technique of online instruction and assistance to bibliographic data
base searchers called Individualized Instruction for Data Access (IIDA) is
being developed by Drexel University.  IIDA assists searchers by providing
feedback based on real-time analysis while searches are being performed.
Extensive help facilities which draw on this analysis are available to
users.  Much of the project's experimental work, as described elsewhere,
is concerned with the process of searching and the behavior of searchers.
This paper will largely address itself to the project's computer system, which
is being developed by subcontract with the Franklin Institute's Science
Information Services.

Feature Comparison of an In-House Information Retrieval System With a
Commercial Search Service
.A
Boyle, S.O.
Miller, A.P.
.W
    A commercially available online search was used as a standard for
comparative searching and evaluation of an in-house information system
based on automatic indexing.  System features were identified and
evaluated on the basis of their usefulness in various kinds of searching,
their ease in implementation, and how they are influenced by differences
in user type or specific applications.  Some common features of the
commercial system, such as online instruction, user-specified print formats,
dictionary display, and truncation, are seen to be unnecessary or
impractical for the in-house system.  In designing the in-house system,
therefore, detald consideration must be given to the applications,
operating environment, and real user needs.  While a commercial system can
serve as a useful standard for comparative evaluation, one must be
careful not to attempt to duplicate it blindly in-house.

Cooperation and Competition Among Library Networks

    Recenty technological advances and the success of OCLC, Inc. has led
to the emergence of three additional nonprofit library networks:  the
Research Libraries Information Network (RLIN) of the Research Libraries
Group, Inc., the University of Toronto Library Automation System (UTLAS),
and the Washington Library Network (WLN).  This paper examines the economic
and technological factors affecting the evolution of these networks and
also explores the role of those state and regional (multistate) networks
that broker OCLC services.  The competitive and cooperative nature of
network relationships is a major theme of the discussion.

    A fast algorithm is described for comparing the lists of terms representing
documents in automatic classification experiments.  The speed of the procedure
arises from the fact that all of the non-zero-valued coefficicents for a given
document are identified together, using an inverted file to the terms in the
document collection.  The complexity and running time of the algorithm are
compared with previously described procedures.

that provide bibliographic files (e.g., OCLC, Inc., RLIN), and service
center (e.g., NELINET, INCOLSA).  It is predicted that as technology
evolves more services will be provided outside the library directly to the
user through his home or office.

The Combined Use of Bibliographic Coupling and Cocitation for Document
Retrieval
.A
Bichteler, J.
Eaton, E.A. III
.W
    A linkage similarity measure which takes into account both the bibliographic
coupling of documents and their cocitations (both cited and citing papers)
produced improved document retrieval over a measure based only on
bibliographic coupling.  The test collection consisted of 1712 papers whose
relevance to specific queries had been judged by users.  To evaluate the
effect of using cocitation data, we calculated for each query two measures
of similarity between each relevant paper and every other paper retrieved.
Papers were then sorted by the similarity measures, producing two ordered
lists.  We then compared the resulting predictions of relevance, partial
relevance, and non-relevance to the user's evaluations of the same papers.
Overall, the change from the bibliographic coupling measure to the linkage
similarity measure, representing the introduction of cocitation data,
resulted in better retrieval performance.

A Translating Computer Interface for End-User Operation of

Marcus, R.S.
Reintjes, J.F.

    The evaluation of the concept of a translating compuyter interface for
simplifying operation of multiple, heterogenous online bibliographic
retrieval systems has been undertaken.  An experimental retrieval system,
named CONIT, was built and tested under controlled conditions with
inexperienced end users.  A detailed analysis of the experimental usages
showed that users were able to master interface operation sufficiently well
to find relevant document references.  Success was attributed, in part,
to a simple command language, adequate online instruction, and a simplified
natural-language, keyword/stem approach to searching.  It is concluded that
operational interfaces of the type studied can provide for increased usability
of existing system in a cost effective manner, especially for searchers.
Furthermore, more advanced interfaces based on improved instruction and
automated search strategy techniques could further enhance retrieval
effectiveness for a wide class of users.
