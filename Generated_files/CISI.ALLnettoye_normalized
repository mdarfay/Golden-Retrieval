use made of technic librari 
thi report is an analysi of 6300 act of use 
in 104 technic librari in the unit kingdom 
librari use is onli one aspect of the wider pattern of 
inform use inform transfer in librari is 
restrict to the use of document it take no 
account of document use outsid the librari still 
less of inform transfer oral from person 
to person the librari act as a channel in onli a 
proport of the situat in which inform is 
transfer 
take technic inform transfer as a whole 
there is no doubt that thi proport is not the 
major one there are user of technic inform 
particularli in technolog rather than scienc 
who visit librari rare if at all reli on desk 
collect of handbook current period and person 
contact with their colleagu and with peopl in other

document dissemin 
thi chapter is direct to those whose vocat or avoc 
is inform while we may call ourselv librarian inform 
scientist or technologist abstractor and index documentalist 
isr specialist literatur searcher and so forth we all have one 
thing in common we are either directli or indirectli involv in the 
dissemin of inform as dissemin we are interest 
in far more than the techniqu for transmiss of inform from 
one point to anoth despit mcluhan 93 statement that the 
medium is the messag we must concern ourselv with not onli the 
mean of document dissemin but also the content and valu of 
the document we dissemin thi idea is preval throughout 
most of the paper review in thi chapter a dissemin should 
think of himself as a select switch center input data 
evalu them select worthi item and direct and control 
their transmiss to a target the reader

amount of inform is becom a domin theme in the manag 
of our way of life we are a technolog orient societi and 
we have natur turn to our commun technolog to help

simpli at the present time there is no clearli defin and well understood 
field of inform scienc and technolog there is not truth to tell 
even clear agreement on what the word inform itself mean and 
particularli on whether it impli a creativ act of the intellect or a 
commod that can be embodi in document transport and exchang

inform need and use in scienc and technolog 
the way in which scientist and engin make use of the inform 
system at their dispos the demand that they put to them the

further work are among the item of knowledg which are necessari for the wise 
plan of scienc inform system and polici besid these 
matter can be of great signific to the behavior scientist interest 
in human organ and commun while user studi have 
not yet gone veri far in serv either of these function the end of 1963 
seem to have been someth of a take off point for empir research 
on the inform need and use of scientist and technologist for 
thi first volum of the annual review we shall therefor cover studi that 
made their appear as far back as the last month of 1963 to give the 
reader a round pictur of a period dure which thi area of research 
ha wit progress along the follow line

chang the singl chapter on autom in librari and inform 
center in volum 2 ha been expand into two chapter one cover 
autom of technic process and the other cover document 
network and a new chapter ha been ad on inform system 
applic in educ such applic are import not just becaus 
they involv in part librari and other inform facil but 
becaus they highlight innov idea and techniqu that should be of

inform need and use 
inform scienc meet behavior scienc in the studi of inform 
need and use at first the meet of these field wa inconclus until 
the mid 1960 there were onli a few substanti studi of inform 
need and use sinc about 1963 howev a signific literatur ha 
grown rapidli 
there is evid now of a product entent between the field 
when inform scientist see reliabl valid and nontrivi data on 
user behavior they begin to use behavior criteria in evalu 
inform system perform when behavior scientist glimps the 
full complex of dissemin document storag and retriev 
process they offer fewer naiv solut to the inform problem

inform need and use 
previou author in thi seri write on thi subject have usual felt 
it necessari to begin with a statement concern the state of the 
methodolog of user studi they have for the most part found it 
improv over the past and thi year is no except in that regard 
there remain howev the tendenc on the part of mani who are untrain 
in social scienc methodolog to assum that the art of questionnair design 
and administr is a veri simpl one that anyon with intellig can 
master in a singl attempt one never realiz how truli wrong thi view is 
until he find himself the author of a review chapter and is then confront 
with the sort of trivia that mani author submit as research paper

annual review of inform scienc and technolog 
the field of inform scienc and technolog continu to grow

technolog support inform activ have help to focu 
special attent not onli on data process and microfilm technolog 
the two tradit mainstay of librari and document handl system 
but also on the rapidli develop capabl in modern tele commun 
thu a chapter on commun technolog ha appear for the first 
time to bring reader up to date on chang in the commun industri 
that have had or will have a great impact on how we design and use 
inform handl system 
two other first time chapter cover manag inform system 
and inform system in state and local govern while 
the intent behind the develop of such system and the kind of 
servic they provid is peripher to the purpos and servic of 
librari and document handl system one often see in these peripher 
area some inform parallel inde one of the reason for the 
annual review cover one or more of these area each year is to 
help it reader exploit more fulli the think and the problem solv

the applic of comput technolog to librari 
especi to the manipul of bibliograph record in 
the perform of librari function is a complex process 
and demand the highest level of talent of both the librari 
and comput profess for it accomplish it cannot be 
accomplish by either profess alon rather the design 
of a librari system is a team effort between librarian 
comput system analyst and programm even a 
limit effort demand care long term plan if it is to 
fit with later effort into a cohes whole the smallest 
project will affect nearli all oper of the librari for

such data as is avail is difficult to evalu compar becaus 
of the differ definit of the oper cost and of the term use to

analysi and organ of knowledg for retriev 
in a univers the mode of research is usual what is call pure or 
basic research sinc i am keep in mind primarili the applic of 
inform scienc i will prefer the word basic although there is not so 
much differ in such research and realli in ani good research one should 
not be collect data haphazardli one must isol and defin a problem and 
as far as possibl control other condit so that interf factor are 
elimin prefer one will narrow down the problem to manag 
proport it is then essenti to approach the problem with some sort of 
hypothesi or theori of the situat and to concentr on obtain 
evid for or against that hypothesi the import task is to devis just 
that crucial experi which will give the answer as effici as possibl 
if the answer disprov the hypothesi one ha at least further evid upon 
which to construct a differ hypothesi if it confirm the hypothesi one 
is readi for a further step forward and so on research is easier in a 
fulli control and reproduc situat in a biolog or human 
situat one must often have recours to statist method but thi doe 
not alter the gener methodolog on the whole i find a clear methodolog 
lack in much that is be done in the field of inform scienc today

a number of possibl reason for thi social scientist face with a much 
smaller total volum of inform were much less inform consciou and 
less inclin to seek for solut there are veri few specialist librari 
in the social scienc and few librarian were therefor confront with 
social scientist inform need in the same way as librarian in

until osti came along there wa littl in the way of fund to support thi 
kind of research thi almost total absenc of previou research had it 
disadvantag and advantag there were veri few clue to guid us and we

five million in 1967 to twenti five million by the year 2000 and their 
total product would go up by a factor of ten he declin to assess 
the associ growth of and need for scientif inform but mere 
state that there would be substanti chang in the way in which scienc 
would actual be transact it is these substanti chang that concern 
the publish editor inform scientist and librarian becaus if we 
do not anticip or at least keep pace with these chang then we will 
not be abl to meet the inform need of our reader and we will becom 
redund scientif inform is a grow industri and it would be 
iron if we could not surviv amid an abund of inform i regard 
the chanc to do someth about the flow of inform as a respons to 
opportun not as an act of desper the big problem is to sort out 
what is pertin among thi inform and in thi world of rapid chang

so we have decid to compar onli the physic and social scienc we have

so you can get some idea of how they differ from the other two group 
befor discuss these differ we should like to emphas that there 
are similar that there are of major import and that they in fact 
make genuin comparison among the group feasibl

citat measur of hard scienc soft scienc technolog and nonscienc 
perhap the fundament problem of those that work in the scientif 
inform industri is that it is not just that special part of an inform 
industri that happen to deal with materi have a scientif content 
technic librarianship involv much more than librarianship appli to 
book with an esoter vocabulari and much mathemat 
my reason for choos thi problem as a contribut for such a strateg 
confer is that i know well as an historian of scienc that the greatest and 
most use advanc in our technolog have not come from the appli 
research of train peopl tri to make themselv use to societi but 
rather from basic research aim at further understand and curious 
and power by the latest instrument that the use peopl have devis

use to basic research in understand scientist than they will to

that the system output is satisfactori howev these 
should be rel few in the case of an inform 
retriev system let us consid one whose function is to 
furnish a refer list as a reaction to a question 
so if we have a set of document s and a set of question 
q the system ha to assign to each question q an answer a q 
which is a subset of s natur thi answer cannot be 
chosen arbitrarili it should reflect a relat between 
the question and the result refer list usual

the word inquiri suggest that the audienc includ person 
interest in the philosophi of scienc thi is true so long as the 
interest is a veri broad one concern with the mean of scienc with 
respect to other social institut health educ moral and so 
on inquiri is by no mean restrict to the disciplin of scienc i

quantit fuzzi semant 
the point of departur in thi paper is the definit of a languag l as 
a fuzzi relat from a set of term t x to a univers of discours 
u y as a fuzzi relat l is character by it membership function 
mltu 0 1 which associ with each order pair x y it grade of 
membership ml x y in l 
given a particular x in t the membership function ml x y defin a fuzzi 
set m x in u whose membership function is given by mm x y ml x y 
the fuzzi set m x is defin to be the mean of the term x with x play 
the role of a name for m x 
if a term x in t is a concaten of other term in t that is 
x x1 xn xi t i epsilon 1 n then the mean of x can be express in 
term of the mean of x1 xn through the use of a lambda express or by 
solv a system of equat in the membership function of the xi which are 
deduc from the syntax tree of x the use of thi approach is illustr by

on the articul of surrog an attempt at an epistemolog 
foundat 
there are two major purpos in mind for thi gather the first is the 
most gener that can be propos for ani gather the simpl advantag of 
bring togeth those who have been at work on a singl problem or at least 
a small class of problem especi when thi problem ha not previous 
benefit from exclus and themat collabor among it investig 
to further such themat collabor the formal present have been 
schedul no more than three each day with time left after each present 
for formal discuss here in the confer room and with as much time as 
possibl given the number of present left free for inform 
discuss 
the second purpos is one of even greater necess in my opinion though 
one not so obviou as the first over and abov the hope for interchang of 
what ha alreadi been thought out in the form of person contact where 
the presenc of the origin of the system or theori can reinforc the 
print word in it usual and ineff way it is my hope that we will all 
be abl especi in our inform discuss to penetr beyond mere 
similar and differ to the underli philosoph base of syntact 
relationship

some remark on inform languag their analysi and comparison 
the machin languag inform languag in our terminolog ds 
should not be confus with the machin code upenskii 59357 in 
ranganathan more gener term there should be no confus between the 
idea plane and the notat plane mani difficulti in classif 
aris from thi confus thi paper is devot mainli to problem on 
the idea plane 
the ir languag i want to talk about is the languag in which the 
inform to be retriev is formul ie a declar sentenc 
languag not the imper sentenc languag of the programm retriev 
bohnert in samet 62110 that is the inform languag should not 
be confus with the program languag to avoid misunderstand 
it would perhap be better to say descript instead of declar 
and to state explicitli that in a descript sentenc an imper may 
be describ which is howev not to be execut by the system but to 
be retriev by appropri search 
.I 478
concept organ for inform retriev 
all analysi of inform for storag and of question for effect 
retriev must be in term of concept and the relat between them 
the concept may be just word descriptor as in simpl post co ordin 
keyword index system or they may be class term or other idea group 
as in classif the relat between concept often appear to be 
absent but if more than one word is use in index or in a search there is 
clearli an implicit relat between them in the mind of the index or 
question and other relat possibl between the word would lead to 
fals drop classif ha tradit been a method of organ 
of concept in which the relat between concept are ostens display 
in the form of group call class

tradit line of demarc among the disciplin are break down 
and in certain area becom almost obliter and librarianship in 
both it technolog and it servic is draw ever closer to the social 
and physic scienc but we would do well to remind ourselv of the 
librari humanist origin otherwis in excess enthusiasm for the

contain absolut no inform on that subject 
the techniqu use we are told with a nudg of 
superior wa to read for metaphys under the 
letter m and for china under the letter c and to 
combin the inform 
i feel that we may be perform just such a miracl 
of creativ juxtaposit when we assum that scientif 
inform is just some special varieti of inform 
that contain queer word like potassium permangan 
pi r squar and number like 271828 we suppos too 
that scientif librari are just librari that happen to be 
full of scientif book and that the best possibl 
technic librarian would be somebodi who had pick up a 
librari qualif and combin it with the appropri 
sort of technic qualif there is as they use to 
say no mixtur of ingredi but a genuin chemic 
compound i wish to point out two simpl fact there is 
more to scholarship than the mere cumul storag

on relev probabilist index and inform retriev 
thi paper report on a novel techniqu for literatur index and 
search in a mechan librari system the notion of relev is taken 
as the key concept in the theori of inform retriev and a compar 
concept of relev is explic in term of the theori of probabl 
the result techniqu call probabilist index allow a comput 
machin given a request for inform to make a statist infer 
and deriv a number call the relev number for each document which 
is a measur of the probabl that the document will satisfi the given request 
rank accord to their probabl relev 
the paper goe on to show that wherea in a convent librari 
system the cross referenc see and see also is base sole on 
the semant close between index term statist measur of 
close between index term can be defin and comput thu given 
an arbitrari request consist of one or mani index term s a machin 
can elabor on it to increas the probabl of select relev 
document that would not otherwis have been select 
final the paper suggest an interpret of the whole librari 
problem as one where the request is consid as a clue on the basi of 
which the librari system make a concaten statist infer

semant road map for literatur searcher 
the retriev of document inform is one of today most widespread 
technic problem affect almost everi larg profession group 
corpor and govern bureau becaus document retriev is in part an 
inform process problem much hope for a solut ha vest in 
comput but larg fast reliabl one have been around now for five year 
and peopl have steadili realiz that the over all task of inform 
retriev is not one of those rote job for which digit comput are made to 
order catalog and search are intellectu task and have been thought 
of as rote not becaus they are menial and straightforward but becaus they 
are unpalat and unwant mani peopl do like to use their mind ye 
but not for plow through and discard irrelev materi 
mani peopl have assum that thi would also be the case in inform 
retriev accordingli the rush to put comput to work in thi area ha led 
primarili to their use as search instrument and much activ ha center 
around the design and oper of search machineri boundari condit 
have been assum such as an ideal searcher who know what he want and who 
know how to express it in term understood by the machin and such as ideal 
correspond of descriptor to the document they describ then attent 
ha been focus on optim the process between these boundari the 
result theori and system in most case seem highli adapt to the need 
of machin but not adapt to the need of human 
we are after all deal with the element situat of an author talk 
to a reader even if by mean of a buffer storag which will grow more and 
more mechan the basic problem is to increas the mental contact between 
the reader and the inform store so that the reader can proceed unerringli

thi paper present an experiment studi of index term frequenc as a factor 
in retriev perform the frequenc of an index term or it breadth as 
it is call here is the number of post made to the term in a given

which are use rel infrequ the experi is a retriev experi 
and use the cranfield salton data breadth of index is vari by 
nonrandomli delet term from document retriev output is evalu use 
the expect search length measur of retriev effect as well as the 
usual precis and recal the wilcoxen test is use to determin the 
statist signific of the differ index the result show that the 
optim breadth of index is a variabl depend on user need if a few 
document are want or high precis is desir then narrow term are more 
effect than broad one if on the other hand all or most relev document 
are want then broad term are better an argument howev can be made for 
the qualiti of narrow term sinc when these term are delet precis never 
improv wherea delet broad term alway result in a higher precis a 
corollari experi is carri out to compar two index of the same 
averag breadth where one index consist of 
semant appropri term term taken from the document titl and the

librari optimum 
sir in hi recent articl bc brook propound an ingeni mathemat 
framework to determin which period volum a librari should hold he is 
care to point out that the select will need regular review and revis 
in case the valu of the age factor a or the 
content of the bradford set chang from year to year there is as yet veri 
littl experiment evid on the consist 
of either such limit evid as there is suggest that the age factor 
is reason constant but the posit of 
the bradfod set is less satisfactori the natur conserv librarian j m 
weingott and s m penni unpublish have lent me a list of titl cite in 
the journal of ecolog three or more time in

both of the thirti three titl cite nine or more time in either year 
onli eight 25 attain that level in both and 
twelv were cite less than three time in the other year the kendal rank 
correl coeffici between the two year is 018 and not signific 
there is anoth major practic problem the articl assum that the data 
analyz to obtain age or util factor and bradford set are valid 
paramet of the rel valu of the literatur to the reader there is no 
mention of the type of data to use the reader who sought guidanc from the 
earlier literatur cite would find practic techniqu describ in which 
analys of citat frequenc are use to calcul util discuss in 
term of librari use krauz and hilling have 
discuss the differ between citat in one articl and futur citat 
to that articl their work impli a more complex 
relat between a and u than brook suggest in ani case the valid of 
citat for forecast librari consult 
remain unproven and there are prima faci reason whi the relationship is not 
necessarili close for exampl one item in a list of refer is often 
intend to lead to a chain of earlier paper again 
each citat repres an author select from a wider group most of 
which he ha consult in a librari in neither case is there ani

the invert mode use a tabl compos of the uniqu

all record number in which each vocabulari word occur for 
exampl an invert tabl construct on titl will have one 
entri for each uniqu word of everi titl in the data base plu 
the record number in which each vocabulari word occur for 
exampl an invert tabl construct on titl will have one 
entri for each uniqu word of everi titl in the data base plu 
the record number in which each word wa found in master 
control a word is defin as ani set of charact bound on 
either side by a legal separ such as a blank period comma 
colon etc on the other hand in a linear search mode the 
data element is compar with the profil word charact by 
charact which result in a prohibit time consum 
process for larg data base

it consequ for societi as a whole and those sociologist who 
are concern first of all with the motiv attitud and goal 
of the individu particip in these pattern of social behavior 
my approach hope to answer the question of whi it is that most 
individu most of the time come to want to do what it is 
that societi need them to do onli when we can answer thi 
question satisfactorili can we develop a sociolog capabl of 
provid both predict and mean

some of my basic concept about the natur of scienc and

those concept were one i had previous drawn partli 
from scientif train itself and partli from a long stand 
avoc interest in the philosophi of scienc somehow 
whatev their pedagog util and their abstract plausibl 
those notion did not at all fit the enterpris that histor studi 
display yet they were and are fundament to mani discuss 
of scienc and their failur of verisimilitud therefor 
seem thoroughli worth pursu the result wa a drastic 
shift in my career plan a shift from physic to histori of 
scienc and then gradual from rel straightforward 
histor problem back to the more philosoph concern that 
had initi led me to histori except for a few articl thi 
essay is the first of my publish work in which these earli 
concern are domin in some part it is an attempt to explain 
to myself and to friend how i happen to be drawn from 
scienc to it histori in the first place

requir seem easi enough to structur the statement 
of a subject in such a way that it can be place into and 
retriev from an order file 
while attempt have been made to use simpl non complex 
term or even singl word it alway becom 
evid that singl word are often insuffici to express a 
subject and that some subject are in themselv complex 
to express such subject requir either that their constitu 
concept not word be separ and then recombin 
or that onli one part of the subject be shown 
the former solut requir that the index perform 
the necessari analysi and synthesi and then separ the 
constitu for the searcher to reassembl the latter 
forc the seeker of inform to sort through mani item 
to find those bear on the complex topic he want and 
ma requir the index to decid under which part s of the

public of the result of the cranfield project which show 
clearli that all index languag are basic the same howev 
although it wa possibl to teach these new approach there wa no 
one textbook which cover the subject approach in the way that i felt 
wa need the first edit wa intend to fill thi gap and it 
recept both in britain and abroad show that it did inde fulfil a 
real need it met with a veri posit welcom from lectur and 
more importantli from student particularli in the unit state

mani librarian have suggest employ compact storag depositori for

system are the fraction of the collect which is to be store and the 
criteria to be use for select materi for storag thi studi 
demonstr that for a given select criterion least cost storag 
quantiti can be assess by balanc the larg circul cost and the 
small shelv cost associ with store materi 
two storag criteria one base upon the age of the materi and the 
other util the individu book usag rate are discuss and compar 
for the age polici the object is the determin of a least cost critic 
age at which materi are transfer to storag and which defin the 
fraction of the collect that should be store the model assum that the 
circul rate of the book declin with age accord to an averag 
geometr pattern of obsolesc 
the averag time gap between the most recent circul of book is 
util as the measur for rate of usag of a book the storag decis 
variabl result from the minim of the total cost function of the usag 
rate polici is a critic intercircul gap the maximum amount of time that 
a book should be permit to remain in a work collect without be 
use those book which are store by the abov rule might be those for which 
the time sinc last use exce the critic intercircul gap henc 
although the least cost select rule is independ of the composit 
distribut of usag rate the fraction of the collect store depend upon 
the circul activ of the individu librari 
an empir evalu of the storag model wa made use data collect 
from three librari at purdu univers and estim of cost paramet 
extract from the literatur calcul for the least cost decis rule 
and the relat cost demonstr that signific save can be realiz from 
storag of materi but the calcul indic that a larg portion of the 
collect must be store 
comparison of the age polici and the usag rate polici indic that the 
latter criterion is prefer for all case examin includ a situat 
where the usag rate polici is handicap with a rel high unit 
reloc cost 
sensit analys of the cost paramet for practic rang of valu 
show that the choic for the length of the plan horizon ha a rel 
insignific effect on the decis rule that chang in the 
capac relat cost paramet will caus signific chang in the result 
and that the rule are extrem sensit to chang in the circul cost
